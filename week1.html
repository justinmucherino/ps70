        <h1 class="main-title">Week 1: Final Project Proposal and Website Development</h1>
        
        <h2 class="section-title"> Website Development</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>This week, I started building a website to document my progress through this course. Instead of using the standard in-class template, because where's the fun in that?, I decided to create my own. Why? So I could inject a little more personality into it and make it something I actually enjoy updating. The goal is to have a space that not only tracks my work but also reflects the style and creativity I'm bringing to this class. Also for some of the layout I took some inspiration from Jackson's website from the Fall semester.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Final Project Proposal</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>The project I'm most excited about, and let's be real, the one that sounds the coolest, is fabricating my own electric skateboard from scratch. Yes, I could just buy one, but where's the challenge in that? Plus, imagine the sheer satisfaction of zooming around campus on something I built—way more rad than just clicking "add to cart."</p>

            <p>I won't lie—this is an ambitious goal. But I think if I can design a simple, cost-effective board that can be operated via remote, it'll be totally worth the effort. And let's be honest, waking up late and needing a fast way to class is basically a universal student experience. An electric skateboard just makes sense.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Initial Design Ideas</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>I'm aiming for a longboard-style electric skateboard with:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A CNC-cut bamboo deck for strength and flexibility.</li>
                <li>Hub motors built into the wheels instead of a belt drive which keeps things simple and beginner-friendly.</li>
                <li>A lithium-ion battery housed in a 3D-printed, waterproof enclosure mounted under the deck.</li>
                <li>A wireless remote controlling speed and braking via an electronic speed controller.</li>
                <li>90mm wheels and standard longboard trucks for a smooth and stable ride.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If time allows, I'd love to customize it further with:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Laser-engraved deck designs for some flair.</li>
                <li>Custom laser-cut grip tape, because details matter.</li>
                <li>Underglow lights</li>
                <li>Custom functionality—TBD, but I'm open to ideas that make it even cooler.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The goal is to keep the design simple, functional, and easy to fabricate while learning CNC machining, 3D printing, and laser cutting along the way. It's a challenge, but one I'm ready to tackle.</p>

            <p>Stay tuned—either this will be an incredible success, or I'll have a very expensive, very stationary piece of wood to show for my efforts.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Alternative Final Project Proposal: Nixie Tube Table Lamp & Pomodoro Timer</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>While the electric skateboard is undeniably cool, I'm also considering a slightly more low-speed project: an integrated table lamp and clock that uses nixie tubes to display the time—with a built-in Pomodoro study timer.</p>

            <p>Now, do I already own a Pomodoro timer that helps keep me on track? Yes. But would it be way sicker if I built my own, designed exactly the way I wanted? Also yes. Obviously.</p>

            <p>This project leans more on the aesthetic and functional side rather than raw engineering, but I think it could be a great mix of form and function. The goal is to create a vintage-meets-modern desk accessory that helps me stay productive while looking incredibly cool doing it.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Initial Design Ideas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Nixie Tube Display: The star of the show—classic, glowing tubes that display the time.</li>
                <li>Pomodoro Timer Functionality: Customizable work/break intervals to keep me on track. Bonus: maybe an automatic setting that forces me back to work after break time. no more 'accidental' 30-minute phone scrolls.</li>
                <li>Dimmable Desk Lamp: Integrated lighting with adjustable brightness—warm light for focus, cool light for when I need to feel like I'm fully sending it.</li>
                <li>Touch or Gesture Control: Because buttons are boring. A tap or wave to start/stop the timer sounds way more fun.</li>
                <li>Custom Engagement Features: Could be anything from sound alerts to changing the lighting color based on time left—maybe even a built-in mild panic mode when my work session is almost up.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why This Project?</h2>
            <p>Unlike the skateboard, this project is a bit more realistic, but still offers plenty of customization and learning opportunities. Plus, nixie tubes just look sick!</p>

            <p>Would this be easier to buy online? Of course. But where's the fun in that?</p>

            <p>I want something that fits my workflow perfectly, looks exactly how I envision it, and has some cool custom features that keep me engaged and productive. If I pull this off, I'll have the ultimate desk companion—one that not only helps me work better, but makes my workspace infinitely more rad.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Alternative Final Project Proposal: Smart Bedside Lockbox for Phone-Free Nights</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>This project might not have the flash of an electric skateboard or the retro-futurism of a nixie tube clock, but what it does have is the potential to save me from myself.</p>

            <p>You may ask, what is this fantastic concept? A 3D-printed, electronically locked bedside safe for my phone. Why? Because at night, I have absolutely no self-control. One minute, I'm setting my alarm and the next, I'm deep into a Wikipedia spiral about medieval siege tactics at 2 AM. This lockbox is my attempt to force better sleep habits by physically separating me from my worst bedtime habit, scrolling.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Initial Design Ideas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Compact & Portable: Small enough to sit on my nightstand but portable like a mini safe, so I could take it with me if needed.</li>
                <li>Electronic Lock System: The box locks via a digital mechanism, preventing me from casually reaching for my phone "just for a second."</li>
                <li>Charging Slot: A cut-out on the bottom allows for a charging cable to pass through, so my phone stays powered without breaking the lockbox's integrity.</li>
                <li>Emergency Override Code with a Catch: In case of a real emergency, I can enter a special override code (maybe something like "911"), but doing so triggers a loud, inescapable alarm for a full minute. This ensures that I don't abuse the emergency option just because I'm feeling weak at midnight.</li>
                <li>Time-Locked Mode: Potentially, I could integrate a timer function where I input a desired unlock time (e.g., 7 AM), and until then, no amount of sleep-deprived bargaining will open it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why This Project?</h2>
            <p>Unlike the skateboard, which may be a bit tricky, or the nixie clock, which is mostly just for looking awesome, this project is about improving my sleep and overall well-being. It's a simple, functional design that solves a very real problem in my life.</p>

            <p>Could I just use willpower? Sure. Is this nearly foolproof? I think so.</p>

            <p>With this project, I get to learn about electronic locking mechanisms, 3D printing, and small-scale hardware design while also building something that will make my life better. It's an easy-to-execute, high-impact idea that I'm genuinely excited about.</p>

            <p>Plus, if it works well, maybe I'll start selling them to fellow sleep-deprived victims of the infinite scroll.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Additional Project Proposal: Smart Electric Lock for My Dad's Back Door</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>For my fourth and final project idea, I'm thinking about designing and building a smart electric lock for one of my dad's back doors.</p>

            <p>Why? Because traditional keys are a hassle, and let's be real—having a custom-built, app-controlled lock sounds way cooler than just getting a regular deadbolt.</p>

            <p>This project takes inspiration from commercial smart locks but customizes the experience to fit exactly what any good back door needs. Plus, it gives me the chance to learn about microcontroller integration and smart home automation.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Initial Design Ideas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Electronic Lock Mechanism: The core component—a motorized deadbolt or latch that can lock and unlock via a wireless signal.</li>
                <li>Keypad & App Control: Users can unlock the door via PIN entry on a keypad or through an app.</li>
                <li>Temporary Passcodes: Wouldn't it be nice to let in a guest or a contractor without handing out physical keys? With temporary, time-sensitive passcodes, this lock could do exactly that.</li>
                <li>Security Features: Potential add-ons could include a lockout function after too many failed attempts or a notification system to alert if someone's trying to tamper with it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why This Project?</h2>
            <p>This one is probably the most practical of all my ideas.</p>

            <p>Would it be easier to just buy a commercial smart lock? Yes.</p>

            <p>Would it be way more satisfying to build my own? Also yes.</p>
